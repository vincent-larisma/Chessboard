# Chessboard - [project 3 and 4 in Avion school (bootcamp)] 
>**This project intends to develop the CSS skill of the user in regards to using animation, flexbox, and grid.**

## What the user learned
>**I learned CSS3 flex and grid. I also learned CSS3 basic animation in the chessboard grid project.**

## Things to take note
>**Each project is not tampered with after being completed except for the readme file as this is a way to showcase the development of the user in each project as each project is a new experience for this user. The chessboard project is projects 3 and 4 since the chessboard flexbox and grid is a separate project but was in a single repo to be uniform. **
